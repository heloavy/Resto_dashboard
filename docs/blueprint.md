- Background color: Off-white (#FAFAFA) to provide a clean and neutral canvas.
- Accent color: Pale violet red (#D87093) for highlights and actionable elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif font for headings. This evokes a clean contemporary style. Body font: 'Inter', a modern sans-serif
- Dashboard-style layout with top navigation bar for easy access to key features, suitable for all devices.
- Simple, professional icons related to restaurant management (e.g., inventory, sales, customers).
- Subtle transitions and animations for interactive elements to improve user experience. Animation should be understated, but professional.
